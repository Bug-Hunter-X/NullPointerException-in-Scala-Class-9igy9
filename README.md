This repository contains a simple example of a NullPointerException in Scala when accessing a value that might be null.  The bug is demonstrated in `bug.scala`, while the solution is in `bugSolution.scala`. The solution demonstrates how to handle potential null values using either pattern matching or optional types (Option). This is a common error when dealing with values that might not always be initialized or come from external sources.
